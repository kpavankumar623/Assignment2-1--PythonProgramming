# Assignment2-1--PythonProgramming


1.Given two numbers, print their sum. However, if the two numbers are the same, return double their sum. input : num1 = 10 ,num2 = 10 expected output => (10 + 10)*2 = 40 input : num1 = 5 , num2 = 10 expected output => (5 + 10) = 15

2.Given a Cost price and Selling price of a product,write program to calculate profit or loss. Profit : if Selling Price > Cost Price Loss : if Selling Price < Cost Price

input : cost price = 100 , selling price = 200 expected output => Profit of 100. input : cost price = 50 , selling price = 20 expected output => Loss of 30

3.Write a program to check whether triangle is valid or not if angles are given. Valid Triangle : Sum of all the angles should be 180 All the angles should be greater than zero

4.Write a program to find out max from the given list of numbers.Also print the index of that element

Input: nums = [10,50,20,90,60,30] max => 90,index is 3

5.Write a program to generate 20 fibonacci series numbers. The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,...

Initial values for fibonacci series: num1 = 0 , num2 = 1 next number is generated by adding adding num1 and num2

6.Write a program to capitalize the vowels from a given string Input string : "Python sample input string" Expected output:"PythOn sAmplE InpUt strIng"

7.Write a program to check if a given string is a valid floating point number or not Input : "14.55" : Valid Floating number "1455." : Invalid floating point number ".144" : Invalid floating point number

8.Write a program to perfrom the matcrix addition. a = [[10,20,30], [40,50,60], [70,80,90]] b = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

output : c = [[11,22,33], [44,55,66], [77,88,99]]

9.Write a program to count the number of occurances of a number from list and store the number and its count in a dict. nums = [10,10,20,10,30,20] Expected output : num_count = {10:3,20:1,30:1}

10.Given a dictionary that contains mapping of employee and his manager { "A", "C" }, { "B", "C" }, { "C", "F" }, { "D", "E" }, { "E", "F" }, { "F", "F" } create a list of managers and directly reporting eployees to that manager Expected output : { "C" : ["A", "B"], "E" : ["D"], "F" : ["C", "E", "F"] } Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys. d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c':300} d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'e':400} Expected output: d3 = {'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'c': 300, 'e': 400}

11.Write a function to convert a given integer (in seconds) to hours, minutes and seconds and return the answer in H:M:S using positional arg passing technique.

12.Given a dictionary of items & their unit prices and the items bought & the quantity, write a function to calculate the total cost of the items plus a given tax using variable length keyword args. If item doesn't exist, the item is ignored. Output should be rounded to two decimal places.

Input : {"A":2500,"B":1000,"C":500,"D":450} Items bought : A, Quantity : 2 Items bought : B, Quantity : 3 Items bought : D, Quantity : 1

Tax = 18%
